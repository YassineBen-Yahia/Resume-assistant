The candidate has a degree in Electronics & Communications Engineering, which is different from the job's requirement of a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science or Software Engineering. However, the candidate's skills and experience in areas like Python, Java, SQL, and Oracle Adf are highly relevant to the job requirements. The candidate's experience as a Principal Applications Developer, Project Lead, Software Development Director, and Senior Software Developer also aligns with the job's requirements. Overall, the candidate appears to be a strong fit for the job, but the degree mismatch may be a concern."
