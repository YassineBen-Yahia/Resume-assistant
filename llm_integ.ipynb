       "\n",
       "1. **Clear and concise format**: The resume is a bit cluttered, with multiple fonts and colors used. Consider using a clean, simple format to make it easier to read.\n",
       "2. **Summary/Objective statement**: A strong summary or objective statement is essential. This should be a brief overview of your background, skills, and career goals. Use it to entice the reader to read further.\n",
       "3. **Quantify achievements**: Instead of just listing your achievements, try to quantify them. For example, instead of saying \"Improved parking lot detection accuracy,\" say \"Improved parking lot detection accuracy by 25% through the use of deep learning models.\"\n",
       "4. **Use action verbs**: Use action verbs like \"Designed,\" \"Developed,\" \"Improved,\" and \"Enhanced\" to describe your achievements.\n",
       "5. **Highlight transferable skills**: Highlight the skills you've developed that are transferable to other industries or roles. For example, your experience with machine learning and deep learning could be valuable in a variety of fields.\n",
       "6. **Education**: Consider adding a separate section for education, with your degree, institution, and relevant courses.\n",
       "7. **Projects**: The projects section is a great way to showcase your skills and experience. Consider adding more details about each project, such as your role, technologies used, and outcomes.\n",
       "8. **Skills**: The skills section is a bit lengthy. Consider breaking it down into categories (e.g., programming languages, technologies, frameworks) to make it easier to read.\n",
       "9. **Contact information**: Make sure your contact information is up-to-date and easily accessible.\n",
       "10. **Proofread**: Finally, proofread your resume multiple times to catch any typos or grammatical errors.\n",
